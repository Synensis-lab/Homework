Task 2: (SQL)

!!!Question 1
Design a cinema booking system.
Think how you would approach the problem and what are potential ways of solving it?


You do not need to write actual code, but describe the high-level approach:
·        Draw a list of key requirements
·        What are your main considerations?
·        What would be your common or biggest problems?
·        What components or tools would you potentially use?
·        You are welcome to draw a diagram (a very simple one) for the process flow to explain how  it is going to work.  !!!
