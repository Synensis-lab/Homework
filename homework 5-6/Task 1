Agile Techniques
Agile is like a philosophy about how to manage projects.
Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile techniques.
The main ethos behind agile is that everybody involved in a project
collaborates frequently. The reason behind this is to become more productive
by not getting to the end of a project and realising that its not exactly what
the client wanted or isn't working correctly.

Question 1

SCRUM CEREMONIES
Scrum ceremonies are meetings or events that are structured and have a defined purpose.

Product backlog refinement.
This is an ongoing communication process between the client and development team.
It is to make sure everybody is clear about the project.

Sprint planning.
This is a meeting used to map out the goals of an upcoming sprint.

Daily scrum.
This is a short daily meeting of ideally no more than 30 minutes.
The purpose is to touch base with each other and check everyone is progressing
and if there are any factors stopping progression.

Sprint review.
Thr review is to produce a specific and defined outcome which is presented
to those with interests in the project for feedback.

Sprint retrospective.
This is the final ceremony of the Scrum process. The idea is to review the
whole process and to see where any improvements can be made in future projects.

SCRUM ROLES.
