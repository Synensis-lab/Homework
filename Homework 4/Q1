 Question 1


GIT WORKFLOW FUNDAMENTALS
·        Working Directory
Working directory is the local files that are being currently worked on. The files have been taken out of the Git directory
database and are ready to worked on and used.
·        Staging Area
 Staging Area is also on the local machine (usually in the Git directory), the files are being prepared to go to the repository. Files are moved from
 working directory to the staging area.
 ·        Local Repo (head)
 The file from the staging area has been moved to the local repository (Git directory). The file has been committed as a snapshot permanently in the git respository.
 ·        Remote repo (master)
The remote repository is on a remote machine. It is where the files are stored remotely. Files are pushed from local to remote and
 pulled from remote to local.

WORKING DIRECTORY STATES:

·        Staged
This means that a modified file has been selected to be committed.
·        Modified
This means that the file has been changed but it has not been added to the database yet.
·        Committed
This means the file has been stored on the local database.

GIT COMMANDS:
·        Git add
Add a file to be committed
·        Git commit
Commit the file as a snapshot on the local repository
·        Git push
send local commits to the remote repository
·        Git fetch
Fetch all the branches from the remote Git
·        Git merge
Merge branch into another (usually to the main branch)
·        Git pull
