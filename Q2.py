# Simple ATM program
# Using exception handling code blocks such as try/ except / else / finally, write a program that simulates an ATM machine to withdraw money.
# (NB: the more code blocks the better, but try to use at least two key words e.g. try/except)
# Tasks:
# 1.       Prompt user for a pin code
# 2.       If the pin code is correct then proceed to the next step, otherwise ask a user to type in a password again.
#    You can give a user a maximum of 3 attempts and then exit a program.
# 3.       Set account balance to 100.
# 4.       Now we need to simulate cash withdrawal
# 5.       Accept the withdrawal amount
# 6.       Subtract the amount from the account balance and display the remaining balance (NOTE! The balance cannot be negative!)
# 7.       However, when a user asks to ‘withdraw’ more money than they have on their account, then you need to raise an error an exit the program.

uinput = input('Enter your 4 digit pin number with no spaces: ')
pin = '1234'

for number in range(2):
    if uinput == pin:
        print('Correct pin')
        break
    else:
        print('Pin not correct. Try again')
        uinput = input('Enter your 4 digit pin number with no spaces: ')

if uinput != pin:
    print('You did not enter correct pin. Your three tries are up!')
    exit()

start_balance = 100
withdraw = int(input('Enter withdrawal amount: £'))
current_balance = start_balance - withdraw

try:
    assert current_balance > 0
except AssertionError:
    print("You do not have enough funds to withdraw this amount. Your current balance is £{}.".format(start_balance))

else:
    print('Your balance is now: £{}'.format(current_balance))

# Using if and else
# if withdraw >= start_balance:
#     print("You do not have enough funds to withdraw this amount. Your current balance is £{}.".format(start_balance))
# else:
#     current_balance = start_balance - withdraw
#     print('Your balance is now: £{}'.format(current_balance))
